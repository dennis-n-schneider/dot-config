# dot-config
A tidy and modern Linux configuration, inspired by the EndeavourOS Community Editions. It can thus be used to kickstart a newly installed Arch Linux Environment.

## Modern NeoVim configuration
NeoVim is configured in Lua with mostly Lua-written alternatives to the most common plugins.

## POSIX-Compliant and clean
The configurations in the ``shell`` directory are independent of the running shell and comply to the POSIX standard. \
The XDG Specification for base directories as well as a clean ``home``-directory are enforced.
