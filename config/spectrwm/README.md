# Spectrwm

## Minimization Capability
Enhances the functionality provided by spectrwm by also integrating the Minimization Manager [Min](https://github.com/dennisschneider-ml/min.git).

## Bar Configuration
A tidy configuration of the spectrwm menubar, which shows important information while remaining efficient in its space consumption.

## Scripts
Handy scripts to perform often-used tasks.
For example, using `rofi` and `pass` for a password manager, or toggling the maximum charging level of the battery of my ThinkPad. This of course only works for ThinkPads.
