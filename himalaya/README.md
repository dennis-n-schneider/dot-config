# Himalaya Configuration
A neat feature of Himalaya is the option to use a shell-command for password-input.
In this manner, I have used the password manager ``pass``. Since a multiline-entry is possible in ``pass``, it only looks at the first line as the password.
Since for privacy reasons, my actual mail-addresses should not be pushed to GitHub, I have added Git-Filters at the corresponding lines and instead added comments of the missing commands.

Further configuration can be seen in ``nvim/plugin/himalaya.lua``.
