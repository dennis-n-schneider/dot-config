# MIME Standard Applications Configuration
The XDG Specification enables a centralized and easy management of default applications.
These application are used by ``xdg-open`` and can be configured in ``../mimeapps.list``.

In order to keep the configuration well-encapsuled, general mime-configurations are used and specified in this directory in the corresponding ``.desktop``-files.
This results in an easy way to change e.g. the default text-editor.

The files listed here are hardlinks to their actual location in the filesystem in ``.local/share/applications/``.
