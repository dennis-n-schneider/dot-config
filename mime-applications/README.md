# MIME Standard Applications Configuration
The XDG Specification ensures a centralized management of default applications.
To accomplish this, filetypes can be configured to be opened with a certain configuration as listed in ``../mimeapps.list``.

In order to keep the configuration well-encapsuled, general mime-configurations are used and specified in this directoy in the corresponding ``.desktop``-files.
This results in an easy way to change e.g. the default text-editor.
