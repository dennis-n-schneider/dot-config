# NeoVim Lua-configuration

This is a NeoVim configuration written only in Lua and using alternatives to popular vim plugins written in Lua.

## Motivation

According to several Benchmarks (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/oqi34r/lua_vs_vimscript_benchmark/), Lua is much faster than the old VimScript-language and actually is a real programming-language, resulting in a tidier configuration.
The advantage of Lua-based plugins lies in their easier and more straight-forward configuration using the Lua-language.
And lastly, since plugins can now be written in a universally-usable programming language, I expect more plugins with better code-quality to be written in general.
